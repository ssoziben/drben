      <h1>HEALTH.</h1>
  <p>Health is one of the major factors that aid development in the world. Nothing can go on in the world when people are  unhealthy and that can be witnessed by the outbreak of global diseases that you all know. </p>
    <p>In this tutorial,I will let you know some basic health tips on how to live a healthy life.I hope you learn something new lets start. Your body needs the following in order to be healthy;</p>
    <h2>WATER</h2>
    <img width=80% src="Screenshot_20211128-160235.png" alt="A Person Drinking Water.">
        <p>Every person requires atleast 2.5 litres of water each day to replace the amount of water used and lost from the body. But what is adequate would be 3.7 litres a day for men and 2.7 litres for women a day as determined by the U.S National Academics of Sciences,Engineering and Medicine. The body uses water in many ways so it must be replaced.Here are some of the ways how water is utilized by the body;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Constituent of blood and other body fluids.</li>
          <li>Constituent of the protoplasm in cells.</li>
          <li>As a medium for metabolic reactions.</li>
          <li>To cool the body through sweating when it is hot.
          </li>
          <li>Transport useful substances like nutrients in the body through blood.</li>
          <li>Removal of waste products of metabolism from the body for example urea through urine.</li>
          
        </ol>
        <p>People who do work that requires alot of energy usually drink alot of water because they lose alot of it through sweating.</p>
        <p>Though drinking water is so useful to the body but taking alot of it is also risky for example; 5 litres to be drank a day can lead to depletion of important minerals like magnesium,potassium,sodium leading to electrolyte imbalances. Some people can develop a condition known as "water intoxication". Therefore drink adequate water not a lot of water.</p>
        <h2>PROTEINS.</h2>
          <img width=70% src="e067b7fd21ba7256507089d97a0d5496.jpg" alt="Foods rich in Proteins.">  
          <p>Proteins are some of the nutrients that each cell in your body needs in order to be healthy and must be included in your diet. Some of the foods rich in proteins include;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Lean meat-beef,veal,mutton,pork.</li>
            <li>Poultry-chicken,turkey,duck.</li>
            <li>Fish and sea foods-fish,crab,lobster.
            </li>
            <li>Eggs.</li>
            <li>Dairy products-milk,yoghurt(especially Greek youghurt),cheese(especially cottage cheese).</li>
          </ol>
            <p>These proteins are very important and here are some of the ways in which they are useful to the body;</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Clotting mechanism.</li>
              <li>Build and repair cells and body tissues including skin,hair,muscle,bone.</li>
              <li>Immune system responses.</li>
              <li>Most hormones are proteins.</li>
              <li>Lower blood pressure.</li>
              <li>Acid-Base balance.</li>
              <li>Proteins in form of antibodies protect animals from diseases.</li>
              <li>Enzymes are protein in nature.</li>
              <li>Control the activity of genes and regulate gene expression.</li>
            </ol>
              <p>Though proteins are useful,it is not advisable to eat alot of foods rich in proteins in otherwards do not eat foods rich in proteins in excess because excess protein can cause damage in people with preexisting kidney disease.This is beacause of the excess nitrogen found in the amino acids that make up proteins.</p>
          <h2>CARBOHYDRATES.</h2>
            <img width=80% src="Screenshot_20211128-161414.png" alt="Foods rich in carbohydrates.">
            <p>Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy.They help fuel your brain,kidneys,heart muscles and central nervous system. Foods rich in carbohydrates include;</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Rice</li>
                <li>Posho</li>
                <li>Potatoes</li>
                <li>Corn</li>
                <li>Spaghetti</li>
                <li>Popcorn</li>
                <li>Oats</li>
                <li>Broccoli</li>
                <li>Doughnuts</li>
              </ol>
        <p>Here are some of the functions of carbohydrates in the body. They include;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Energy production</li>
          <li>Energy storage</li>
          <li>Sparing protein to be used for energy.</li>
          <li>Assisting in lipid metabolism </li>
        </ol>
      <p>Carbohydrates can be in form of;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Non-starch polysaccharides (dietary fibre):Cellulose,pectins,hemicellulose</li>
        <li>Starch polysaccharides:Amylose,amylopectin,maltodextins</li>
        <li>Monosaccharides:Glucose,fructose,galactose</li>
        <li>Disaccharides:Sucrose,lactose,maltose</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Excess carbohydrates in form of glucose are stored in the body as glycogen.Carbohydrates are useful but harmful to the body if consumed in excess.Here is how they are harmful;</p>
        <p>The normal blood glucose level in the body is 90mg/100 cubic centimetres of blood.If your blood glucose increases above that level,the pancrease releases a hormone called insulin which converts the excess glucose to glycogen and stored in the liver.If your blood glucose level is low,the pancrease releases a hormone called glucagon which converts the stored glycogen in the liver to glucose in order to maintain a normal blood glucose level in your body.</p>
        <p>If your pancrease is damaged in otherwards if it gets a problem and you continue eating very many carbohydrates,your blood glucose increases and yet the pancrease which releases insulin is damaged so the blood glucose will keep on increasing in your blood stream hence Type 2 diabetes.</p>
